To load specific environment file: Modify virtualhubo.py file (in etc/hubo-ach) with sudo priveleges and text editor e.g. using sudo or gksudo geddit to open the file


The VirtualHubo file under the hubo-ach installation must be modified to load either the valve turn or peginhole environment. Otherwise the environment loaded will be the default one.

To make sure the objects are loaded correctly the 'files' and 'objects' directories must must be under this master "peg_in_hole_and_valve_turn_complete" directory.
