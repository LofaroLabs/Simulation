Avahi Configuration Steps:
These steps assume your ethernet connection to the robot is on eth0.
Shutdown Baxter and disconnect ethernet cable.
Connect the laptop/workstation to Baxter using a Category-5 ethernet cable.
Power up Baxter.

Disable firewall on laptop if necessary:
    $ sudo ufw disable

Turn off the Ubuntu Network-Manager to prevent interference:
Go to the Networking Icon drop-down menu in the top-right of the Desktop.

Make sure 'Enable Networking' is unchecked (if checked, select the option in the menu to disable)
Check status of eth0:
    $ ifconfig eth0

You should not see any IP addresses under 'inet'.
Use Avahi to designate an IP address to eth0 (do not close the terminal after running avahi-autoipd):
    $ sudo avahi-autoipd eth0

Make sure an IP address is successfully claimed. eg:
    Found user 'avahi-autoipd' (UID 104) and group 'avahi-autoipd' (GID 111).
    Successfully called chroot().
    Successfully dropped root privileges.
    Starting with address 169.254.8.16
    Callout BIND, address 169.254.8.16 on interface eth0
    Successfully claimed IP address 169.254.8.16

Keep this Terminal running in the background.
Open a New Terminal to continue.

Find the local hostname of the robot by running avahi-browse:
    $ avahi-browse -a -r
   The default local hostname of the robot is the Serial Number followed by local. Ex: '011303P0017.local'.
